## 🚀 Featured Project: MarketPulseAI

### 📊 Overview
MarketPulseAI is my most ambitious side project to date - an advanced real-time analytics platform that combines traditional stock market data analysis with social media sentiment to provide holistic market insights. The system processes millions of data points per minute to detect market patterns and sentiment shifts that often precede price movements, giving users a potential edge in understanding market dynamics.

### 🔑 Core Value Proposition
MarketPulseAI stands apart through its dual-analysis approach:
1. **Traditional Price Data Analysis**: Deep learning models process market metrics to predict potential price movements
2. **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**: NLP algorithms capture market mood and emotional drivers of price action

This combination delivers a more complete picture of what's driving stock prices, integrating both quantitative factors and human sentiment that influences market behavior.

### 💻 Technology Stack

#### Data Infrastructure
- **Ingestion**: Apache Kafka + Kafka Connect
- **Processing**: Apache Spark (Stream Processing)
- **Storage**: 
  - Redis (real-time features/online store)
  - Cassandra (historical market data/offline store)
  - Elasticsearch (social media content/text data)

#### Machine Learning & Analytics
- **Market Analysis**: Custom deep learning models
- **Text Processing**: Advanced NLP for sentiment analysis
- **Signal Integration**: Weighted ensemble models

#### Deployment & Operations
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **API Layer**: FastAPI
- **Visualization**: Streamlit dashboards
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets

### 🧠 Key Insights From Development
- Social sentiment shifts sometimes predict price movements 1-3 hours before they appear in market data
- The relative importance of technical vs. sentiment features varies dramatically based on market conditions
- Quality and consistency of input data proved far more important than model sophistication for prediction accuracy

### 📈 Current Status & Next Steps
MarketPulseAI is still in active development. I'm currently working on:
- Expanding data sources (options flow, institutional trading patterns)
- Optimizing the pipeline for improved throughput and reduced latency
- Developing enhanced visualization dashboards
- Preparing for cloud deployment with managed services

*Disclaimer: MarketPulseAI is an EDUCATIONAL exploration, not an investment tool.*
